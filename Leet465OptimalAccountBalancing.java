/**
 * A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid
 * for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each
 * transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and
 * Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be
 * represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].
 * 
 * Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions
 * required to settle the debt.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
 * Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the
 * persons 0, 2, 6.
