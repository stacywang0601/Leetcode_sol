 * Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
 * TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as
 * http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.
 * 
 * Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your
 * encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny
 * URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
